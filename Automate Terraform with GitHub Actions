1)  Need to have accounts in GitHub, AWS and Terraform cloud.
2)  Create a workspace in Terraform cloud "jenkins" and select "API-driven Workflow".
3)  Add "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" and "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" as enviornment variables for workspace and select secret access key as sensitive.
4)  Create an API token using link: https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens in Terraform cloud save this token.
5)  Create a new repository and add workflows(Terraform_Plan.yml and Terraform_Apply.yml) in .github directoy.
6) In above yaml files, mention the environment variables used by the workflow. Replace organization, API-token and workspace accordingly.
7)  Nagivate to settings page in new repository. Open the "Secrets and variables" menu then select "Actions".
8)  Now select "New repository secret". Create a secret named "jenkins", setting the Terraform API Token created in the previous step as the value.
9)  We can clone this repo to our local machine and create a new branch(terraform) to work on jenkins.tf file.
10) Once terraform file is ready, push these changes to our repo.
11) Now open the pull-request in terraform branch or create a new pull from terraform branch.
12) Pull request will trigger "Terraform plan" actions workflow. When the workflow completes it will add a comment with link to speculative plan.
13) Click the "Terraform Cloud Plan" link to view the plan in Terraform cloud.
14) Now Merge the pull request then we can see "Terraform Apply" action workflow in "Actions" tab.
15) We can verify by checking the created EC2 in AWS.
